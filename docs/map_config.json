Despite their name, fishers do not eat fish and instead they prey on squirrels, snowshoe hares, and even porcupines. In BC, Pacific fishers are rare and declining, with fragmented populations in the southern interior and isolated individuals in the Sea-to-sky region.",

Males are considerably smaller than females. They are highly adaptable and often found near water, where they hunt amphibians and small fish. Garter snakes are active during the day and hibernate communally in winter, sometimes in large numbers. They give birth to live young and use their keen sense of smell and tongue-flicking to locate prey. In BC, several subspecies exist, including the common western garter snake and the more aquatic valley garter snake. In the Sea-to-Sky the most frequently seen is the common garter snake.",

Their coloration ranges from olive to brown with dark bands, and have the ability to drop their tails to escape predators. These lizards are secretive and often found under logs, rocks, or leaf litter. They are active during warm months and hibernate in winter. Alligator lizards give birth to live young rather than laying eggs, a rare trait among reptiles in BC.",

      "description": "Landscape features that prevent or severely restrict movement, fragmenting habitats and isolating populations. These can be natural (e.g., large rivers, mountain ranges) but are often human-made structures, such as major roads, clusters of buildings, fences, and agricultural clearings. Barriers are modelled as areas of high resistance to movement within a landscape resistance surface, effectively identifying where connectivity linkages are broken or severely compromised. Specific interventions can include installing wildlife crossings (overpasses and underpasses) on roads, removing unnecessary fences, and restoring habitat within narrow corridor sections.",

      "description": "Narrow landscape features that restrict or hinder wildlife movement within an otherwise continuous ecological network. Natural pinch points include sudden topographic changes, such as steep ravines or channelized creeks. Human-made pinch points include fencing that physically guides larger mammals into narrow movement paths, and crossing structures, such as culverts and underpasses, that direct the movement of smaller mammals and herptiles across roads and other linear infrastructure features. Mitigating the adverse effects of these pinch points requires harmonizing land-use policies across jurisdictional boundaries.",
