# Map Viewer Help

## Getting Started

This interactive map portal was developed by [Nature Squamish](https://naturesquamish.ca) to present, and make accessible, the mapping and modelling outputs of the [Wildlife Connectivity Project](). 

Our interactive map portal allows you to explore, and learn about, the various ecological themes, sub-themes, and indicators developed during the project, through an intuitive interface.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Choose a Theme

Themes are high level groupings of common ecological data and serve as an entry point into the vast collection of maps we have produced.

Choosing a theme will narrow down the options available in the sub-theme dropdown.

### Step 2: Choose a Sub-theme  

Sub-themes are more specific groupings of ecological data that are related to the selected theme.

Choosing a sub-theme will narrow down the options available in the indicator dropdown.

### Step 3: Choose an Indicator

Finally, indicators are the specific data that we have mapped and modelled. It is these layers that allow you to explore and analyse the data.

Selecting an indicator will load the map and related data.
